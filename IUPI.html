	<h4>Instructions</h4>
	<p>Luckily for UPRRP students, their infrastructure is more modern than the one in UPRM. Thus, there's no need for overly complicated instructions. I strongly recommend not using telnet like it says on your web portal and instead use SSH. Just enter the following command in <b>Terminal</b>:</p>
	<pre class="code-snippet" id="c1" class="code-snippet">ssh matricula@rrpadm.uprrp.edu</pre>
	<p>Press <b>Return</b>.</p>
	<p>When you're asked for a password, rather than using the password provided by the MIUPI portal, use <code>enero2018</code>. You should now be connected to the RRPADM system.</p>
	<p>Please send any questions or feedback to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}?subject=IUPI">my email</a>.</p>

Welcome to Perez Consulting! We specialize on Apple product consulting such as Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and even Apple TV.

If you need software help or want to deploy a small pool of Apple products for your company, Perez Consulting is for you.

We've been working with Apple software and hardware for over 8 years. From macOS Sierra to iOS 10, we know these systems like the back of our hands. We work with devices that are not considered by Apple as vintage or obsolete. [^1]

### Will you repair my iPhone screen?

We do not do iPhone screen repairs mostly because there is no viable profit margin on these kind of repairs.  

For in-warranty repairs, [Modernica](https://www.facebook.com/modernicaonline) cover this at their Plaza Las Americas store. For out-of-warranty repairs, we recommend [Dr. iPhone](https://www.facebook.com/DriphonePR/) in Mayag√ºez Mall.

### Do you have an office?

No, we currently do not have an office. Our consultations are done via email, phone, or on-site.

### Do you offer discounts?

Unfortunately, we currently do not offer discounts. A contract rate can be negotiated for on-going maintenance of deployments.

[^1]: We do not cover warranty repairs. Any repairs done by us will void the manufacturer's warranty.

I've been working with Apple software for over 8 years. From macOS Sierra to iOS 10, I know these systems like the back of my hand. If you need software help or want to deploy a small pool of Apple products for your company, contact me.[^1]

## FAQ

### How can I contact you?

First-contact inquiries are handled by [email](mailto:{{ site.consulting-email | encode_email }}). After this we can exchange phone numbers for easier communication.

### What are your business hours?

I'll reply and answer to email and phone consultations respectively from 10:00AM to 6:00PM. For on-site consultations, please email me to schedule a visit.

### What are your prices?

Our prices are as follows:

* iOS and macOS diagnostics start at $25. Software repair pricing is a variable rate, ranging from $10 to $30 additionally. This second variable rate can be waived at my own discretion i.e. only charge you for diagnostics.
* Consulting on product deployments is done on a per-hour rate. The current rate is $100 per hour.

A contract can be arranged for product deployments.

### What payment methods do you accept?

I accept Apple Pay Cash, Venmo, PayPal, ATH M&oacute;vil, and cash. I do not accept checks.

### Where are you located?

My base of operations is in the city of Cabo Rojo in Puerto Rico.

### Do you have an office where I can visit?

No, I currently do not have an office. Consultations are done via email, phone, or on-site.

### Will you repair/replace my iPhone's screen?

I don't do iPhone screen repairs mostly because there is no viable profit margin on these kind of repairs.  

For in-warranty repairs, [modernica](https://www.facebook.com/modernicaonline) will cover this at their Plaza Las Am&eacute;ricas store. If you're on the West coast, modernica will ship your phone to their Plaza Las Am&eacute;ricas store for a $50 fee.  

For out-of-warranty repairs, I recommend [Dr. iPhone](https://www.facebook.com/DriphonePR/) in Mayag√ºez Mall.

### Do you offer discounts?

Unfortunately, I do not offer discounts. A contract rate can be negotiated for on-going maintenance of deployments.

These FAQs are not permanent. Some may change, some may be added in the future.

[^1]: I do not do hardware or hardware warranty repairs. Only software.

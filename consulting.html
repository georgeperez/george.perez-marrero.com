<p>I've been working with Apple software for over 8 years. From macOS Sierra to iOS 10, I know these systems like the back of my hand. If you need software help or want to deploy a small pool of Apple products for your company, contact me.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>How can I contact you?</h3>

<p>First-contact inquiries are handled by <a href="mailto:{{ site.consulting-email | encode_email }}">email</a>. After this we can exchange phone numbers for easier communication.</p>

<h3>What are your business hours?</h3>

<p>I'll reply and answer to email and phone consultations respectively from 10:00AM to 6:00PM. For on-site consultations, please email me to schedule a visit.</p>

<h3>What are your prices?</h3>

<p>Our prices are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS and macOS diagnostics start at $25. Software repair pricing is a variable rate, ranging from $10 to $30 additionally. This second variable rate can be waived at my own discretion i.e. only charge you for diagnostics.</li>

<li>Consulting on product deployments is done on a per-hour rate. The current rate is $100 per hour.</li>
</ul>

<p>A contract can be arranged for product deployments.</p>

<h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>

<h3>Where are you located?</h3>

<p>My base of operations is in the city of Cabo Rojo in Puerto Rico.</p>

<h3>Do you have an office where I can visit?</h3>

<p>No, I currently do not have an office. Consultations are done via email, phone, or on-site.</p>

<h3>Will you repair/replace my iPhone's screen?</h3>

<p>I don't do iPhone screen repairs mostly because there is no viable profit margin on these kind of repairs.  </p>

<p>For in-warranty repairs, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/modernicaonline">modernica</a> will cover this at their Plaza Las Am&eacute;ricas store. If you're on the West coast, modernica will ship your phone to their Plaza Las Am&eacute;ricas store for a $50 fee.  </p>

<p>For out-of-warranty repairs, I recommend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DriphonePR/">Dr. iPhone</a> in Mayagüez Mall.</p>

<h3>Do you offer discounts?</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, I do not offer discounts. A contract rate can be negotiated for on-going maintenance of deployments.</p>

<p>These FAQs are not permanent. Some may change, some may be added in the future.</p>

<p>After 3 years since the initial wake of the connection problem on macOS, the CTI (Centro de Tecnolog&iacute;as de Informaci&oacute;n) has upgraded the servers that run the RUMAD (Matricula) system. As a consequence of this change, when you try to reconnect after November 11, 2019 you will see the following warning message:</p>

<p>To fix this, simply copy and paste the following command in <b>Terminal</b>:</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">ssh-keygen -R rumad.uprm.edu</pre>

<p>Press <b>Return</b>. This will regenerate the RUMAD key.</p>

<p>Once this is done, reconnect to <code>rumad.uprm.edu</code> using the following command (copy and paste into your Terminal window):</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">ssh estudiante@rumad.uprm.edu</pre>

<p>Press <b>Return</b>. You will connect to the RUMAD system successfully. If you are still having issues, please email me with as many screenshots as you can.</p>

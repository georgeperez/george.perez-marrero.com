<h2>RUMAD on macOS</h2>

<p>As a consequence of a recent upgrade by the Centro de Tecnolog√≠as de Informaci&oacute;n (CTI), it is possible that when trying to reconnect to RUMAD (Matricula, colloquially/erronously known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY">PuTTY</a>") after November 11, 2019 you will see the following warning message:</p>

<p>To fix this, simply copy and paste the following command in <b>Terminal</b>:</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">ssh-keygen -R rumad.uprm.edu</pre>

<p>Press <b>Return</b>. This will regenerate the RUMAD key.</p>

<p>Once this is done, reconnect to <code>rumad.uprm.edu</code> using the following command (copy and paste into your Terminal window):</p>

<pre class="code-snippet">ssh estudiante@rumad.uprm.edu</pre>

<p>Press <b>Return</b>. You will connect to the RUMAD system successfully.</p>

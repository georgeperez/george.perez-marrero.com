title: About George
---
My name is George Pérez-Marrero. I'm an undergrad at the [University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez](https://uprm.edu/).

Some of my interests include macOS, iOS, programming, tinkering with computers (absolutely does *NOT* mean fixing them), photography, and a good cappuccino.

Want to contact me? Send me an [email](mailto:george@georgeperezmarrero.com), DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/georgeperez/), message me on [Facebook Messenger](https://m.me/georgeperezmarrero/), or iMessage, but only if you ask.

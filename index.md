Hey, my name is George P&eacute;rez-Marrero. Iâ€™m a computer science undergrad at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag&uuml;ez currently working at the Puerto Rico Water Resources and Environmental Research Institute. Previously, I worked at the Puerto Rico Seismic Network. I'm interested in [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/), [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/), [RHEL-based distros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux), [movies](https://letterboxd.com/georgeperez/), and [photography](https://instagram.com/georgeperez/).

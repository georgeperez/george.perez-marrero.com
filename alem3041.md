## Purchase Digital Access to iLrn

These instructions are for students who only intend to take ALEM3041 (Part I).

If you intend to take other parts of this course, you should consider subscribing to Cengage Unlimited or purchasing the physical textbook at the UPRM bookstore instead. Current pricing for each (as of 01/28/2020): $119.99 for 1 Term (4 Months) and $115 for the physical textbook (unknown term length for iLrn platform).

Purchasing instructions for Cengage Unlimited and Digital Platform are the same. Replace "Digital Platform" name where appropriate.

### 0. Open a Cengage.com account

<blockquote><h4>IMPORTANT</h4>You need to sign up for the iLrn platform separately from Cengage. Follow the professor's instructions on the ecourses course page. You can do this either before or after getting your book key.</blockquote>

Press this link to create your account: [https://login.cengagebrain.com/cb/login.htm](https://login.cengagebrain.com/cb/login.htm)

### 4. Activate iLrn with Book Key

After purchasing your textbook, you will get two emails: an order receipt and a book key receipt.

On the Book Key receipt email, you will see your 19-character book key.

To enter your book key, go to the iLrn website: [https://hlc.quia.com/books/](https://hlc.quia.com/books/)

If you haven't signed up yet, follow the professor's instructions posted on ecourses. Once you've done this it will ask you to enter your book key. Enter it. **Ignore the "This package will expire before the class ends" warning**. The professor has set the end-of-course date as August 2020 which causes your 6-month access to expire before that date.

After you've done this, your iLrn workstation will look like this:

And you're done. Good luck!

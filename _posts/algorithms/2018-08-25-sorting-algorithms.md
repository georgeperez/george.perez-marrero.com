These sorting algorithms are pretty easy to explain. I get confused when all the mathematical symbols are used,
but they're easy to follow. If this keeps going, maybe this class won't be so hard.

I'm so confused. Most of the time I'm so lost I don't even know what I should be
asking the professor. I'm not saying I don't understand _anything_ at all, but I
find it a bit hard to explain what I don't understand. Really hope the rest of
the semester isn't like this at all, and that I get into a groove and understand
the topics.

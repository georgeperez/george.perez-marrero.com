At first I didn't really understand how to apply dynamic programming and memoization
to an arbitrary problem. The assembly line example was something that I didn't understand and memoization was something else
I didn't understand. Maybe after watching some YouTube videos I'll understand it a bit more.

Wikipedia pages are very informative for algorithms and computer science concepts, who knew.

Surprisingly, I think I did well on my presentation. The professor didn't ask a lot of questions, which could either mean
something good or something bad. I'm really hoping it good rather than bad. I presented a
HackerRank problem and submitted it myself. Got the full 35 points for it!

Professor didn't seem too fussed.

I'm so confused. Most of the time I'm so lost I don't even know what I should be
asking the professor. I'm not saying I don't understand _anything_ at all, but I
find it a bit hard to explain what I don't understand. Really hope the rest of
the semester isn't like this at all, and that I get into a groove and understand
the topics.

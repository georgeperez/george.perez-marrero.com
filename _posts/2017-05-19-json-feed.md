JSON Feed is now supported. This will be the only syndication format for this website. You can view it [here]({{ site.url}}/feed.json) and preview it [on the web](https://json-feed-viewer.herokuapp.com) (website created by [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://twitter.com/vaillancourtmax).)

I adapted it from [Niclas Darville](https://ndarville.com/blog/2017/05/19/json-feed-for-jekyll/) for my site, with some additions like linked post support.

You can view a gist of the code [here](https://gist.github.com/georgeperez/dcc7856055ac1550f0a94d4e288c7818).

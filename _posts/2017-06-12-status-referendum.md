Someone from New York asked in the [/r/PuertoRico subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/PuertoRico) why the plebiscite had low voter turnout and I decided to give it a shot.

For those that are not aware, Puerto Rico had a vote this past Sunday in a non-binding referendum regarding its current territorial status with the United States. So why was turnout abysmal for something seemingly important?

First off, there are three main political parties here in Puerto Rico: the **New Progressive Party** (PNP, pro-statehood), the **Popular Democratic Party** (PPD, pro-status-quo,) and the **Puerto Rico Independence Party** (PIP, pro-independence.)

The state legislative branch and the state executive branch are currently held by the PNP. The current governor, Ricardo "Ricky" Rosselló, promised during his campaign to hold a referendum towards the "immediate decolonization" of Puerto Rico. When he assumed office on January 2, 2017, he started the lobbying effort to introduce a bill that would establish the referendum.

This referendum was controversial from the start. When it was introduced, the only options that were on the ballot were statehood and independence. This angered the minority party (rightfuly so) in the legislative branch, the PPD. Like I mentioned earlier, the PPD is pro-status-quo. The bill was debated and many amendments were introduced to include the status quo or clarify the language on the ballot. Ultimately, these amendments were defeated by the sizable majority of the PNP in the upper and lower houses. The bill passed and then signed into law by the Roselló. The bill was sent to the U.S. Department of Justice to review its validity in order to be the first federally-sponsored referendum cementing the "official status" of this referendum. It would also receive $2.5 million for education on the different territorial options and for the actual ballot. This fund was assigned in the 2013 omnibus budget bill while President Obama was still in office.

Turns out, this bill was not designed in accordance with the Constitution of the United States and was deemed invalid. The DOJ argued that a referendum that does not include the current territorial status means that it won't represent the will of the people of Puerto Rico and therefore have an artificial lead towards one of the options. DOJ said that if they add the current status **AND** postpone the referendum from the June 11th date they would be able to do a second review in order to assign the $2.5 million fund.

The governor and the legislative branch amended the law and added the status quo option and sent it to the DOJ for further review, but did **NOT** change the June 11th date. Since that day, the PNP and DOJ have been mum on what was decided on the second referendum. Because of this, and because the status quo wasn't added in the first place, the PPD and PIP launched a boycott campaign. As you can see, it was very successful. In addition, this referendum had an estimated cost of $7.5 million which is being categorized as an extravagant waste of money considering our current financial woes.

I consider myself a Democrat and a liberal. I'm not ashamed to be called such things. I also vote independent locally, because none of the parties here are good. I'm also a supporter of Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. and all the other US territories deciding what their political and economic relationship with the United States should be. I happen to support statehood, but that does not mean that you get to strip of all other electorates their right to vote for their preferred status. This plebiscite was a bad idea from the start, nothing but false promises ([Sound familiar?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROMESA))

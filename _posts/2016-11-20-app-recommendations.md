I'm very picky when it comes to software. I am not one of those people who routinely goes to the App Store, looks at the "New Apps We Love" section, and downloads new apps. Usually, for me to try out an app, it has to be recommended or acclaimed as a good app. I've found apps like [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com), [Narwhal](http://getnarwhal.com), [Textastic](https://textasticapp.com), and [Infuse](https://firecore.com/infuse) this way. These apps and utilities are used daily on my devices. Without them, my enjoyment (and thus my productivity) would grind to a halt. 

Sidenote: Believe it or not, I use the offical social networking apps i.e. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, so you won't find recommendations on that here.

#### [1Password](https://1password.com)   
Using the same password on multiple websites or services is the one of the worst possible things you could do, and this is why using a password manager is a good investment.  

With 1Password, you can randomly generate complex passwords to use for all of your accounts. It also monitors websites to check if there's been a credential leak, and it will warn you with its Watchtower feature. When I get a new device, the first thing I install is 1Password. Why? I literally can't log in into anything without it. It's an essential.  

A word of advice is to always enable Two-Factor Authentication on every account of yours that has it. It will make hacking your account much more difficult because you would need a second method of verification, often times your phone.

#### [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)   
If you're serious about Mac development or expanding your Macs' feature set, you'd be crazy not installing this. It is the best way to install GitHub-hosted packages or open source software. As an extension, I also recommend you install Xcode.  

You can replace Apple versions of popular open source development utilities, which tend to be a bit behind from the official sources. One of these replaceable utilities is [Git](https://git-scm.com).

A few tools you can install to start off are [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) for downloading YouTube videos, [Cask](https://caskroom.github.io) to install applications, [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage Ruby versions, [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) to encode video, and Sindre Sorhus's [Quick Look Plugins](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins).  

#### [Sublime Text 3](https://sublimetext.com)   
When I started writing code, I used the very popular text editor [TextMate](https://macromates.com). It's a great text editor, but the lact of autocompletion (or rather, the way it handled it) was not something I liked. Here's where Sublime Text 3 comes in. Out of the box, it supports pretty much the same amount of languages as TextMate, but with the added benefit of "return completion." With [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) you can get even more languages, themes, and even added features like Git branch status.  

#### [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit)   
Transmit's UI looks like a lot like the other SFTP apps out there, but it feels like something Apple themselves engineered. It's fast, efficient, and overall a great piece of software to use. If you ever need to connect to a remote server to access files, this is the app to use.

#### [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)   
On macOS, the way to uninstall apps is a bit different than the way it's done Windows. If you want to remove an app, you have to drag the application to the Trash. You would think that's all you need to do, right?  

Unfortunately, doing so will leave a plethora of preference files in your system folders. With an app like AppCleaner, you simply look for the app you want to uninstall, drag-and-drop it in AppCleaner and voil√†, the app and its preference files are presented to you. From there, you can decide if you want to delete all files or leave some if you're thinking of installing it later on.

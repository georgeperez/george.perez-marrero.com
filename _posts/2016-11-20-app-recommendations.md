title: My recommended iOS and Mac software for new users
---

To get the blog started and familiarize myself with Jekyll, I'll list out a few app recommendations for Mac and iOS and explain why I use them.  

#### [1Password](https://1password.com)  
1Password is _the best_ password manager out there by far. They have apps for Mac, iOS, Android, and even Windows. When I get a new device, the first thing I install is 1Password. Why? I literally can't log in into any other apps without it, because I use its password generator on all of my accounts. It's an essential.

#### [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)  
If you're serious about Mac development or expanding your Macs' feature set, you can't do wrong with installing it.  

A few things you can install to start off are [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/), [Cask](https://caskroom.github.io), [Git](https://git-scm.com), [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org).  

#### [Sublime Text 3](https://sublimetext.com)  
Best text editor out there. Out of the box, it supports a lot of languages like C++, Python, Markdown, you name it. With [Package Control](http://packagecontrol.io) you can get even more languages, themes, and even added features like Git branch status.  

#### [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit)  
Best SFTP app out there. Hands down. The UI looks like a lot of other (S)FTP out there, but Transmit's looks and feels like something Apple themselves engineered.  

#### AppCleaner  
Uninstalling apps on Mac is a bit different than on Windows. If you want to remove an app, you have to drag the application to the Trash. **_But_** doing so leaves a bunch of preference files lurking in your system folders. With an app like AppCleaner, that's not longer the case. You simply select the app you want to remove, drag-and-drop it in AppCleaner's window and voil√†, the app and its preference files are gone.

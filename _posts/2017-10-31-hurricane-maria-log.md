### Day negative two - September eighteen

At this point, Hurricane Maria was still a category 4 and hurdling past the Leeward Islands. Puerto Rico was under hurricane watch, but a warning was imminent. My family and I had some practice not two weeks ago when Hurricane Irma graced us in the Northeast, so the second time around was much easier to setup.

### Day negative one - September nineteen

Hurricane Warning has been issued. My phone beeped the loudest notification sound in the world. So did my father’s, my brother’s, my sister’s. Everyone was now fully aware. This thing is coming.

### Day zero - September twenty

This is it. At 3:00AM AST, almost like it was intentional, power was cutoff. For the rest of the night, we were kept cool by the A/C air that was leftover and the gushing winds of Maria outside. Cool inside + cool outside = cool all around.

At 6:00AM, almost like clockwork, I woke up. I checked my phone, and was met with two words you never want to see on your phone: “No service”. Since I knew my phone would keep looking for a signal and drain my battery, I quickly put my phone airplane mode. For good measure, I also turned low power mode on.

### Day one - September twenty-first

Water is still going strong. Power? Forget about it. Still no service. This is all kinds of crazy.

### Day two - September twenty-second

Still no power, still no cell service.

First time going outside our neighborhood. Flooded valleys, fallen trees and power lines, and muddy roads as far as the eye can see. This cemented the conclusion that many had before the hurricane event hit: this is going to change Puerto Rico, and it’s going to be a screeching slow recovery. It would not surprise me if the estimates the state power authority gave are proven to be at least 90% to 100% true.

Gas lines are a mile long. Gas is being dispatched in dollar amounts, not liters. $20 was the limit per car. We didn’t even try.

Luckily our semi trailers that we use for storage a town away from us were intact. The area around it not so much, a huge mango tree snapped and blocked most of the entrance to the storage area. You could only get by on foot.

### Day three - September twenty-third

Telecommunications are up at 25% capacity, but all in the metro area. Priority has been assigned to cell towers with no damage.

We drove from Cabo Rojo to Añasco to visit my mother and grandmother. We left at 8:00AM to we wouldn’t find a lot of traffic.

We reached Añasco at about 9:00AM to cross paths with them. They were about to drive to Cabo Rojo. Wireless phone service still limited to the metro area, we didn’t have any way to communicate with them. So if we hadn’t crossed paths, we would’ve driven for nothing. 

Since my grandmother has a gas stove, we had lunch. 

After that we left to visit relatives in Rincón. They were all fine. My mother drove us back to Cabo Rojo later that day.

### Day four - September twenty-four

An uneventful day. We didn’t listen to the radio today. We just stayed inside and played some cards. Go Fish was a hit.

Still, to make matters worse, at sundown we noticed low water pressure. Within 5 minutes, there was no water. Time to take out the water buckets.

### Day five - September twenty-five

Still no water. After all these days with water, it feels like a smack in the face to lose it now. While the island pretty much lost both at the same time, Cabo Rojo seemed to lose it last.

Tried to go to my workplace to help, but wasn’t allowed into campus because it was deemed too dangerous. Had to make a U-turn and go home. Water came back but not by a lot. Still very little that the shower head can’t get the right pressure.

### Day six - September twenty-six

Water pressure is stable (as in, stable like yesterday).

Today we didn’t do anything. Heard on the radio that cleanup for my college campus will be at least a month long.

I cleaned and made my room like it was pre-hurricane. We all moved our valuables to a secure place beforehand, so this was something to take my mind off things.

### Day seven - September twenty-seven

Went out to fill up our small gas tank that we use for food. Bought canned food and threw out all the food in our refrigerator.

Pretty much stayed home today. My mother came by and filled up a dozen plastic bottles. Still no power, still no cell service, still no full water pressure.

It’s been a week. An entire week. Progress has only stayed in San Juan. Mayagüez’s medical center received power though, that’s pretty great in my opinion. They were having problems with their diesel power generators.

### Day eight - September twenty-eight

Woke up at around 5:30AM. Drank some water and went back to bed. Stayed there with my eyes closed and pretty much waited until my 7AM alarm buzzed.

Showered, ate breakfast, and headed out to look for gasoline.

The West coast has typically being forgotten when a major natural disaster occurs. Much of the food comes through San Juan, and often times it stays around the metro area. Kind of reminds me of the Capitol in The Hunger Games.

Why am I mentioning this? Well, because the West coast is currently in a gas crisis. While the metro area is pretty much in working order, the West coast is not. There’s almost mile-long lines to fill up $10 worth of gasoline. People line up since 3AM to be one of the first (and possibly only) to fill up those $10 at 8-9AM when those gas stations open.

It’s supposed to be back to normal. At least, that’s what I’m hoping for. My dad and I are heading out to try to fill up our large gas containers but we’re not sure if there’s still a $10 limit. Rumor has it there’s a gas station in the heart of town that’s independent and still giving out full-amount gas.

1:33PM - didn’t find any gas. We’re currently trying to siphon gas out of an old car in our house. 

If that doesn’t work, we’ll try to go again at 4:00PM.

That didn’t work.

...

Eureka! We found gas. Only managed to fill up one of the five-gallon gas containers.

### Day nine - September twenty-nine

We went around the neighborhood and picked up a bunch of fallen palm leaves. Spent a few hours doing that, showered afterwards, and relaxed.

We went again today to look for gas. And we found it. We filled one of the cars, and filled two five-gallon containers.

After that we just waited until darkness fell and went to sleep.

### Day ten - September thirty

A kind enough neighbor let’s use their diesel power generator for our refrigerators. We also use them to connect three medium-sized fans at night directed at us. We put all our mattresses in the living room floor so we didn’t have to do logistics on who will get what fan for their room.

Ate a tuna sandwich for breakfast with some iced tea.

Continued doing some work around the neighborhood. Don’t think this will get done by the right authorities, ever.

### Day eleven - October one

Had breakfast at a Ricomini bakery in Mayagüez with my mother. She turned on Personal Hotspot and I finally connected to the internet after eleven days. Sent a message to a Slack team of friends that I was safe, marked myself as safe on Facebook, and paid a few bills that didn't have any relief (Looking at you, American Express). After that we returned home and started doing a job we were hired to do in the neighborhood.

It was a pretty simple job in paper. In execution? _Definitely not_. We lasso'd up two almost-fallen palm trees and pulled them until they dropped to the floor. After that, we cut them up in two four roughly equal length logs and moved them to my dad's truck. After that, we dropped them off at the designated place to unload scraps.

This took a few hours, like three or four. We only managed to do two palm trees before it started pouring. We left an unfinished job and vowed to return the next day.

### Day twelve - October two

We woke up, had breakfast, and started mowing our lawn. The equipment had enough gas that we didn't have to break into our gas supplies from a few days ago. 

Finished up in a couple of hours and showered. Had lunch, and then just waited. Water pressure was less with every passing day…

### Day thirteen - October three

Can’t recollect.

### Day fourteen - October four

Can’t recollect.

### Day fifteen - October five

Today is one of my best friend’s birthday. It sucks that he has to celebrate it like this (I bet he even isn’t).

Can’t recollect anything else.

### Day sixteen - October six

Today we learned that my sibling’s school was giving classes since September twenty-five (Day five). They have no power, but they do have some water. Don’t know if it’s a cistern or if their water station is fully working again.

Mowed our neighbor’s front lawn and backyard for $20. Everyone chipped in.

### Day seventeen - October seven

Woke up, had breakfast, and drove to Añasco to spend some time with our mother. We had lunch over there again but we didn’t go anywhere, really. We lounged in the living room until 4:00PM when we went back to Cabo Rojo. 

Left my house keys over there. Good thing there’s like seven copies in the house.

### Day eighteen - October eight

Nothing eventful. Went to the vet to pickup some allergy medicine for our six year-old Yorkie (She’ll soon be seven, on October twenty-three)

### Day nineteen - October nine

Had a salami sandwich for breakfast. My siblings went to school and catch up on their work. I stayed home. Don’t know what to do to entertain myself.

### Day forty-one - October thirty-one

Second day of fall semester after Hurricane Maria. It’s also Halloween.

Less people are dressed up than years past. Each year there was a memorable moment with someone dressing up and taking pictures (Last year, it was two people with the T-rex costume).

I stopped writing after day nineteen, but started writing again now. On day thirty-nine we got our power restored. After thirty-nine days, we finally had some power and some resemblance of normalcy.

This is my last entry. I hope you found it “interesting”, even though I know it wasn’t. I didn’t write this to entertain. Just did it to write something.
